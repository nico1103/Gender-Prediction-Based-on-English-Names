# Gender-Prediction-Based-on-English-Names

This is my project on classification in my supervised machine learning class.
Dataset is from Kaggle and records are based on 2013 baby names.
Tested with various classification methods such as KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, NB classifiers and picked the model with the best accuracy score, after carefully tuning hyperparameters and cross-validation.
