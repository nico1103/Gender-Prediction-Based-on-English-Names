# Gender-Prediction-Based-on-English-Names

Objective: Developed a classification model to predict gender based on English baby names using a Kaggle dataset from 2013.
Data Processing: Performed feature extraction and preprocessing to optimize model input representation.
Methodology: Evaluated multiple classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB).
Optimization: Conducted hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance model accuracy.
Outcome: Achieved high prediction accuracy by selecting the best-performing model, demonstrating strong analytical skills and a deep understanding of classification techniques.
